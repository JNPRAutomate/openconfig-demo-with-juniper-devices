[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksator/openconfig-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksator/openconfig-demo)

### What to find on this repo:   
Content about how to use Openconfig with Juniper devices.   
I built it to run an Openconfig demo with Juniper devices (using OpenConfig BGP models).    
It covers various options to interact with Juniper devices running Openconfig modules:     
- Devices CLI (Command Line Interface) (for Humans)
- NetConf in an SSH connection
- Network automation with Ansible   
- Network automation with PyEZ (python library to interact with Junos)   
- Network automation with nnclient (netconf client python library)  

So it includes also various automation content about using Openconfig with Juniper devices.  
It also covers basic usages of some nice tools for YANG:  
- pyang  
- pyangbind

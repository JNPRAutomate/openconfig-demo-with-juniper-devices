### What to find on this repo:   
I built this repo to run an Openconfig demo on Juniper devices.  
You will find content about how to use Openconfig with Juniper devices.  It covers various approaches to interact with the devices: 
**CLI** 
**Ansible** 
**PyEZ** (python librairy to interact with Junos) 
**nnclient** (python netconf client)
**Netconf** (RPCs inside a netconf session)
So it also includes automation content about Openconfig on Juniper devices.

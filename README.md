### What to find on this repo:   
Content about how to use Openconfig with Juniper devices.   
I built it to run an Openconfig demo on Juniper devices.  
It covers various options to interact with Juniper devices running Openconfig modules:     
- Devices Command Line Interface 
- Network automation with Ansible   
- Network automation with PyEZ (python library to interact with Junos)   
- Network automation with nnclient (python netconf client)  
- Using RPCs inside a NetConf session  

So it also includes various automation content about Openconfig on Juniper devices.  
It also covers basic usages of nice tools for YANG:  
- pyang  
- pyangbind
